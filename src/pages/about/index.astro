        Welcome to Simple Reads Books!<br />
      </p>
      <p class="font-medium">
        My name is Deborah Martin, and I am the award-winning author of Hunnie
        Bunny's Garden, the first book in the Hunnie Bunny series.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have always enjoyed writing children’s stories and decided to finally
        publish Hunnie Bunny’s Garden after my grandson’s birth In August of
        2022. Even though I wrote Hunnie Bunny’s Garden in 1985 when my son was
        two years old, I never forgot about the story and recently was able to
        find the perfect illustrator to bring the story to life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Growing up in Roanoke, Virginia, we had lots of pets, including cats,
        dogs, bunnies, birds and fish, all at the same time. So, it was natural
        for me to write about animals as I grew older. I believe that children
        learn empathy, respect and responsibility when pets are part of the
        family.
      </p>

      <p>
        Horses have always been my first love and true passion, and I was
        fortunate to buy my first horse when I was in college. Some of my best
        years were spent showing my thoroughbred mare in hunter shows.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I moved to California, I gave up riding to raise my family and
        didn’t buy another horse until our son went off to college. I now have
        three horses, a chestnut Appendix Quarter horse gelding named Crimson
        Sky, a black German warmblood gelding named San Fransisko, and a bay
        Oldenburg gelding named Santana. All three are trained in dressage and
        have done extremely well at shows with their professional rider.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides my horses, I have two other four-legged children: a
        fifteen-year-old Bluepoint Balinese cat named Zoie (who is quite the
        diva in our house) and an eight-year-old Bluepoint Birman/Siamese mix
        named Rascal (who definitely lives up to his name). They are wonderful
        companions, and my home wouldn’t be the same without them!
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope you will join the Simple Reads Books community and share my books
        with your family and friends. Enjoy!
