This is a sweet young childrenâ€™s book about the cycle of gardening as seen through the eyes of
well-illustrated charming woodland animal characters. I purchased this as a gift for my toddler-
age grandnephews who live in another state.

Hoping for a sequel to see what happens next in the story.`,

This is my 12 month old's absolute favorite book! He pulls it out multiple times a day.
<br /><br />
The characters are adorable and I love how the story brings awareness to the joys of growing and
eating vegetables, which is a very important message for children to get early on.
<br /><br />
I highly recommend this book for kids of all ages!`,
