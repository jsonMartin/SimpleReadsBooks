      <p class="font-medium -mt-[30px]">Welcome to Simple Reads Books!<br /></p>
      <p class="font-medium">My name is Deborah Martin and I am the author of the Hunnie Bunny book series.</p>

      <p>
        I have always enjoyed writing children’s stories and decided to finally publish Hunnie Bunny’s Garden after my grandson’s birth In August of 2022. Even
        though I wrote Hunnie Bunny’s Garden in 1985 when my son was two years old, I never forgot about the story and recently was able to find the perfect
        illustrator to bring the story to life.
      </p>

      <p>
        Growing up in Roanoke, Virginia, we had lots of pets, including cats, dogs, bunnies, birds and fish, all at the same time. So, it was natural for me to
        write about animals as I grew older. I believe that children learn empathy, respect and responsibility when pets are part of the family.
      </p>

      <p>
        Horses have always been my first love and true passion, and I was fortunate to buy my first horse when I was in college. Some of my best years were
        spent showing my thoroughbred mare in hunter shows.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I moved to California, I gave up riding to raise my family and didn’t buy another horse until our son went off to college. I now have three horses,
        a chestnut Appendix Quarter horse gelding named Crimson Sky, a black German warmblood gelding named San Fransisko, and a bay Oldenburg gelding named
        Santana. All three are trained in dressage and have done extremely well at shows with their professional rider.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides my horses, I have two other four-legged children: a fifteen-year-old Bluepoint Balinese cat named Zoie (who is quite the diva in our house) and
        an eight-year-old Bluepoint Birman/Siamese mix named Rascal (who definitely lives up to his name). They are wonderful companions, and my home wouldn’t
        be the same without them!
      </p>

      <p>I hope you will join the Simple Reads Books community and share my books with your family and friends. Enjoy!</p>
